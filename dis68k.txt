            Motorola MC68000 cross-disassembler by W. de Waal.

This disassembler takes a binary file and disassembles it as MC68000 opcodes.
(Similar to MSDOS DEBUG disassembly.)

Usage: DIS68K filename [/f]
Where: filename is compulsory and
       /f is an optional switch to specify file output.

The input file (filename.BIN) is the binary (Machine code). The optional map
file (filename.MAP) maps the input file into code and data areas. Code areas
are disassembled, data areas are dumped. An example of the map file is:

romstart = 0x00002000
0x00002000,0x00002100,code
0x00002101,0x0000220f,data
0x00002210,0x00002280,code
0x00002281,0x00002fff,data

This file tells the disassembler that the code normally starts at $2000. The
first line maps $2000-$2100 as code, the second line maps $2101-$220f as data,
and so forth.

To disassemble a file, the entire file is mapped as code. Areas of data are
then identified and specified as data. In this way a program can quickly be
disassembled.

The disassembly output is written to the screen, and to the file filename.DIS
if the /f option is specified.

Enjoy!

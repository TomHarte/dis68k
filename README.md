# dis68k

_dis68k_ is a public domain disassembler for the 68000, originally released in 1991 and written in era-appropriate unstandardised C.

This fork of dis68k seeks to modernise that source code:
* to ensure that it builds with modern compilers;
* to give it normative command-line invocation; and
* where possible, to adapt the code to utilise more modern language constructs.
